    <h1> Happy Birthday Papa </h1>
    <h2>To the man who can fix my problems just easily as a cycle.</h2>

    <p>
      You are strength when things get heavy,  
      calm when the world gets loud,  
      and the quiet hero behind every win.  
      Today isnt just your birthday—  
      its a reminder of how lucky i am to have you.
    </p>

    <p>
        Please go for a walk and jog every day.
        Its good for your health and keeps you active.
